            First welcome to the frontpage, I appreciate you taking the time to review some of my work. My name is
            Brianda Hernandez. and I am an upcoming IT professional. Through my diverse life experiences of having been
            a collegiate soccer player, military service member and IT professional, my mindset has developed into that
            of a driven individual focused on accomplishing their goals. Currently, I work as the Tech Liaison of the
            Chief Executive Office (CEO) of a county government. My day-to-day responsibilities include coordinating
            with the IT department, such as software updates, hardware repairs, live meeting production assistance &
            digital workflow development.

            Outside of work, I spend my time with my significant other and two dogs, Whiskey & Tera. Thankfully because
            of COVID and the mandate to work from home I have been able to spend more quality time with them. The dogs
            love taking walks, but they are mostly indoor dogs, so the walks are short. Which leads me to your
            invitation, by keeping this short and sweet. So, without further ado please enjoy exploring the rest of my
            site.

            My path as a web developer has not been linear or quick, in fact I did not even start out in IT. Before, I
            was a soccer player and coach. I taught all ages and positions, but I was mostly a goalkeeper coach. Now I
            did try to go pro but because of a concussion I was not able to sign that season and I had to find another
            path. Hence, my entrance into the military. Where I enlisted as a Cyber Transportation Specialist, pretty
            much a fancy way of saying I would be working in IT. This would be the start of my second love. When I
            started my tech (or job) school, I immediately fell in love with everything I was learning, including
            circuits, diodes, switches, routers, crypto and more. Unfortunately, when I got stationed at my first base,
            I mostly worked with long-range satellite technology, therefore I did not get to work with the day-to-day
            computer equipment. Then, after 3 years, my time with the military was over and I became a civilian again.
            Where almost immediately I enrolled in school to finish my Computer Science degree, continuing my education
            of IT. However, I got sidetrack by playing collegiate soccer for the school and taking the massive amount of
            general education courses. Then I got sidetracked again by transferring schools to City College of San
            Francisco (CCSF) and adding another degree. I added the Computer Networking & Information Technology degree
            to my list of degrees to get. It was a decision that was made with the idea of getting a job as an IT
            Support Specialist, instead of the administrative assistant positions I had been in. Which worked because I
            was hired by Nevada County as a temporary Computer Services Technician. Now up to this point I had no clue
            what I wanted to do in the IT field. I just knew that I wanted to be a part of it. So, this is where working
            for Nevada County was extremely helpful because they had a smaller IT department. Where I was exposed to or
            work with people in other areas of technology. I specifically liked working with one of the Analysts there.
            Many times, we exchange stories of different client interactions, military experiences, and information
            about the different projects we were working on. They inducted me into the world of the internet and web
            development. In fact, I remember us going over the <a href="https://www.espn.com/ " target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"> ESPN home page </a> and all the different elements of the page. Now, I
            wouldnâ€™t say that the website has influenced my decision to become a web developer, but it will influence my
            style of web design in the future. Considering that I have only been learning HTML/CSS for 4 months, I have
            to think of the future and not the past. However, this website shows me that I appreciate a layout that
            efficiently displays a mass and various amount of information.

                rel="noopener noreferrer">"A Brief History of Web Development."</a> You could even start at <a

        <h3>Good Links</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3School's website</a>
                will always be a good and quick resource for me. I like how it has individual pages for different
                elements and a sandbox sample of code displaying the use of that same element. </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.enlightenjobs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enlighten Jobs</a> is
                great because they are extremely helpful in providing a quick way for me to do job searches. I use it to
                keep up to date on what skills I should be learning outside of the CCSF's ciriculum for a Computer
                Science degree. For example you could search for <a
                    href="http://www.enlightenjobs.com/jobs.php?location=&q=Web+Developer" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Developer</a> as a position, and they would provide links to different
                job searching websites, where (if you click the link) provides you with a page with prefilled search
                phrases. Then all you have to do is enter the location you would be looking in.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Ninjas</a> is where I
                go to do coding challenges on the language I am working on at that time.</li>
