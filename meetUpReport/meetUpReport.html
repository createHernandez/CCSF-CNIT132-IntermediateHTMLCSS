        <h3>freeCodeCamp - Greater Sacramento Area </h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a>  group of the Greater Sacramento Area is great band of people who are <q>working towards a common goal: to become better developers.</q> They are open to anyone who is interested at any skill level and meet on a somewhat regular basis. During their <a href="http://meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-Greater-Sacramento-Area/events/jrlzhsycchbmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Hangout,</a> the new people to the group make their introductions, and the rest of the meeting is spent going over members ongoing projects, along with feedback time. Their next meeting is an example of the other types of events they hold. where a member of the group volunteers to organize and lead a targeted discussion. For example, at the time of this writting, the next talk will be <a href="https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-Greater-Sacramento-Area/events/jrlzhsycchbtb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Git: From 0 to Production</a> by Bryan Jenks, who is a mjor contributer to this group. 
            <br><br> 
            One of the take aways from attending the Developer Hangout's is that I have a lot of work to do. I mean it was honestly intimidating how much code I was seeing, with each project that got presented. Although looking back now, (it has been a month since the last meetup,) the meetup also showed me what the difference is between less than 6 months of experience and three years or more.
            <br><br> 
            Now, I do want to mention that along with the Develop Meetings this group hosts, they also maintain a Discord, (I got a Discord invite during one of the Developer Hangout's,) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sacramento/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Page</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp-Sacramento" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub account</a>. In fact, below is a screenshot of me using the Git Cheat Sheet off of their GitHub.
